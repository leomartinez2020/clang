![The seven steps](/assets/images/clang-seven-steps.png)

The programmer begins by devising an algorithm for the task and splits the planning phase into four steps. After creating a proper algorithm,
the programmer proceeds to Step 5, translating the plan into code. This phase may start slowly due to unfamiliarity with syntax, but it is
generally straightforward. If the algorithm includes complex steps, they are turned into separate programming tasks.

The next step, Step 6, involves testing the implemented code to uncover errors in the algorithm or implementation. If errors are found, the
programmer proceeds to Step 7, debugging, to identify and fix the issues. The programmer may need to revisit algorithm design or code
translation to address errors. This testing and debugging process is repeated until the programmer is convinced that the program is correct,
although no amount of testing can guarantee absolute correctness. The text mentions that the programmer's confidence in the code's correctness
increases with more testing.
